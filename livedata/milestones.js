If there later are concrete needs for supporting all types, both implementation and documentation can be changed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4222/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4221","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4221/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4221/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4221/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4221","id":1128540782,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85DRCpu","number":4221,"title":"Argument validation fails in dry-run if arguments contain `&{dict}` variables","user":{"login":"amoxuk","id":26641021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjQxMDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26641021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amoxuk","html_url":"https://github.com/amoxuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amoxuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amoxuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amoxuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amoxuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amoxuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amoxuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amoxuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amoxuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amoxuk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013645,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":219378453,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTkzNzg0NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/beta%201","name":"beta 1","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/52","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52/labels","id":5081658,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTA4MTY1OA==","number":52,"title":"v5.0","description":"New major release concentrating on adding new syntax to Robot Framework language: `TRY/EXCEPT` (#3075), `WHILE` (#4084), inline `IF` (#4093), `RETURN` (#4078) as well as `BREAK` and `CONTINUE` (#4079).

Both can be specified directly in data, give from the command line (only for top level suite), and there are keywords for modifying them during execution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4199/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4195","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4195/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4195/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4195/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4195","id":1109229625,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85CHYA5","number":4195,"title":"Log: Linking to warnings and `--expandkeywords` broken with IF/ELSE structures","user":{"login":"DirkRichter","id":20930315,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTMwMzE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20930315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DirkRichter","html_url":"https://github.com/DirkRichter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DirkRichter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DirkRichter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DirkRichter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DirkRichter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DirkRichter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DirkRichter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DirkRichter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DirkRichter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DirkRichter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013645,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":175630288,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzU2MzAyODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/alpha%201","name":"alpha 1","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/52","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52/labels","id":5081658,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTA4MTY1OA==","number":52,"title":"v5.0","description":"New major release concentrating on adding new syntax to Robot Framework language: `TRY/EXCEPT` (#3075), `WHILE` (#4084), inline `IF` (#4093), `RETURN` (#4078) as well as `BREAK` and `CONTINUE` (#4079).

For example, this is possible:\r\n```\r\n*** Keywords ***\r\nLooping\r\n    FOR    ${x}    IN    @{stuff}\r\n        Keyword\r\n    END\r\n\r\nKeyword\r\n    Exit For Loop\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis kind of loop control that can happen outside loops can be really hard to understand and can create a big mess. It is also not something that other languages like Python support. When designing native `BREAK` and `CONTINUE` (#4079) to replace these keywords, we agreed not to support them inside keywords. To simplify implementation and to have just one \"rules\" for loop control, we also decided to prohibit `Exit For Loop` and `Continue For Loop` in keywords.\r\n\r\nThis change is naturally backwards incompatible and affects everyone who has used these keywords inside keywords, not directly inside loops. We try to avoid such changes in general, but we believe that's fine in this case for the following reasons:\r\n- As already mentioned, it's good that these keywords work the same way as `BREAK` and `CONTINUE`. And we don't want `BREAK` and `CONTINUE` to work inside keywords.\r\n- The plan is to deprecate and remove these keywords in favor of `BREAK` and `CONTINUE`. Everyone eventually needs to change their tests/tasks anyway.\r\n- The change happens in a major release where breaking changes are more ok than in other releases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4185/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4185/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4184","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4184/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4184/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4184/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4184","id":1103303563,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85BwxOL","number":4184,"title":"Show FOR loop body in log also if there is nothing to loop over","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430514,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzA1MTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20low","name":"priority: low","color":"41ae76","default":false,"description":""},{"id":175630288,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzU2MzAyODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/alpha%201","name":"alpha 1","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/52","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52/labels","id":5081658,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTA4MTY1OA==","number":52,"title":"v5.0","description":"New major release concentrating on adding new syntax to Robot Framework language: `TRY/EXCEPT` (#3075), `WHILE` (#4084), inline `IF` (#4093), `RETURN` (#4078) as well as `BREAK` and `CONTINUE` (#4079).

One good example is SeleniumLibrary, that makes it possible to register a keyword that will be executed if any of its own keywords fails. Sometimes, especially when doing task automation, it is also beneficial to log actions done by the keyword in the log file separately. For example,\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_something():\r\n    do_first_thing()\r\n    do_second_thing()\r\n```\r\nwill in the log file be shown as a single keyword without any child keywords, but there are sometimes needs to show `do_first_thing` and `do_second_thing` as child keywords.\r\n\r\nNowadays keywords can execute other keywords by using `BuiltIn.run_keyword`. It works but has several problems:\r\n\r\n1. Arguments are resolved twice. This  means replacing variables and handling syntax like `\\n`. For example, if we have a keyword like\r\n    ```python\r\n    def example(arg):\r\n        BuiltIn().run_keyword('Log To Console', arg)\r\n    ```\r\n    and call it like\r\n    ```\r\n    Example    c:\\\\temp\r\n    ```\r\n    the actually logged string has a tab character. The reason is that `\\\\t` is first resolved to string `\\t` which is then on the second round resolved to a tab.\r\n\r\n    Double resolving can be avoided be registering the keyword to be a \"run keyword variant\", but that API isn't really public and it's also pretty bad in general. We have #2190 about enhancing it and making it public, but it would probably be better to avoid this double resolving altogether.\r\n\r\n2. Related to above, the keyword using `BuiltIn.run_keyword` cannot safely call it without escaping strings. For example, something like `BuiltIn.run_keyword('Log To Console', 'c:\\\\temp')` won't work correctly and the argument should be `c:\\\\\\\\temp` instead.\r\n\r\n3. `BuiltIn.run_keyword` only accepts positional arguments. For example, if we had a keyword implemented like\r\n    ```pyhton\r\n    def example(upper=False):\r\n        ...\r\n    ```\r\n    we couldn't call it like Â´BuiltIn.run_keyword('Example', upper=True)` but instead needed to use `BuiltIn.run_keywod('Example', 'upper=True')`.\r\n\r\nThe above examples ought to make it clear that a better API is needed. I have some ideas how to API could look and will write separate comments about that a bit later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4210","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4210/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4210/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4210/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4210","id":1118587633,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85CrErx","number":4210,"title":"Enhance errror detection at parsing time","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/61","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61/labels","id":7269150,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Abuse","number":61,"title":"v5.1","description":"New feature release with main focus in improving support for other languages than English.

A problem with detecting errors only at the execution time is that they aren't reported to tools like editor plugins that use Robot's parser. We should thus move error detection to parser as much as possible. This includes at least these cases:\r\n\r\n- Empty test and keyword.\r\n- `RETURN` used in test.\r\n- `BREAK/CONTINUE` outside loops.\r\n- `RETURN/BREAK/CONTINUE` in `FINALLY`.\r\n- `END` when there is no block open.\r\n\r\nWe also have a similar problem that some of the error situations detected by the parser are not detected as early as they could be. For example, having `IF` with more than one condition is detected by the parser when the parsing model is validated, but the underlying tokens do not get `ERROR` type. This is a problem if only using tokens (i.e. when using `get_tokens`, not `get_model`) and also when using the model it would be more convenient if invalid tokens could be easily detected.

That typically works fine, but issue #4065 demonstrates it can cause problems with some processes. It would be better to use `stdin=None` by default. It would avoid problems like in #4065 and be the same as the default behavior of the underlying [subprocess.Popen](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen).\r\n\r\nThe problem with this change is that it can cause backwards compatibility problems. In most cases there's no difference, but in some case being able to write to the stdin of the started process can be handy. Our own acceptance tests use this functionality and it's possible/likely that also others are using it. We made stdin configurable in RF 4.1.2 (#4102) so if the pipe behavior is desired, `stdin=PIPE` can be used explicitly.\r\n\r\nI think we can change this already in RF 5.0 because it's unlikely many users are affected and `stdin=PIPE` can be used explicitly.

I expect it to fail as if in case when the non-matching value was given to the keyword directly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4069/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3902","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3902/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3902/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3902/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3902","id":839110433,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4MzkxMTA0MzM=","number":3902,"title":"Support serializing executable test suite into JSON","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/61","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61/labels","id":7269150,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Abuse","number":61,"title":"v5.1","description":"New feature release with main focus in improving support for other languages than English.

That has worked very well, and it would be nice if something like that would work also with variables defined in test data. We probably could re-use the underlying argument conversion logic which ought to make it relatively easy to implement this. We also got a similar request related to variables passed from the command line #2946.\r\n\r\nAutomatically converting numbers like `42` and `3.14` to actual integers/floats would be handy, even when we already support them as variables like `${42}` and `${3.14}`. Being able to use datatime objects, bytes, and other types supported by the argument conversion that don't have direct variable alternatives would naturally be even more useful (but also less commonly needed). I would expect this to be most useful with lists and dictionaries and especially with nested list and dicts that cannot easily be constructed in Robot's data.\r\n\r\nMy proposed syntax for this functionality is supporting \"type postfix\" like `:int` in variable names like this:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n${COUNT:int}         42\r\n${GOOD IDEA:bool}    Yes    # Converted to Boolean True\r\n${ANIMALS:list}      ['cat', 'dog', 'horse']    # Python syntax\r\n${NESTED:dict}       {'a': 1, 'b': [{'x': 2}, {'x': 3}]}    # Great with JSON\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis syntax is derived from Python's function annotation syntax and also the same syntax that was decided to be used with command line variables in #2946. Variable names would naturally be created without the type prefix like `${COUNT}` and `${GOOD IDEA}`.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being available in the variable section, the new syntax should also be available also when creating variable otherwise, including in keyword arguments:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Keywords ***\r\nExample\r\n    [Arguments]    ${count:int}\r\n    ${nested:dict} =    Set Variable    {'a': ${count}, 'b': [{'x': 2}, {'x': 3}]}\r\n    Set Test Variable    ${DATE:datetime}     2019-08-23 12:03:42\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are some design decision still to be made like should `${X:dict}` create a `DotDict` instance that allows `${X.key}` syntax and how to handle possible backwards incompatibility issues. For most parts the design looks pretty good, though, and I think this would be a valuable addition to Robot Framework. If there's enough interest, we can consider adding this already to RF 3.2 scope.

It would allow using keywords in places where currently you'd normally just have plain strings (or variables). Example usages are listed below and possible syntax alternatives discussed in separate comments.\r\n\r\n1. Arguments to other keywords.

That wasn't certain based on the issue description, but profiling by running `/usr/bin/time -v rebot output.xml` with `output.xml` containing 1000 dummy test cases showed that maximum memory sure enough had raised from ~102MB with RF 3.2.2 to ~123MB with RF 4.1.1. Unfortunate `/usr/bin/time -v` doesn't show where the memory is spent, but `git bisect` revealed that the commit causing pretty big increase in memory usage was 21c6b468a6f19181e44300c2be5a3fa4afd28471.\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned commit added direct `setup` and `teardown` attributes to `TestSuite` and `TestCase` objects and `teardown` to `Keyword`. That was a good change from the API point of view, but each `TestSuite` and more importantly `TestCase` always having `setup` and `teardown` that are represented as `Keyword` objects takes some memory. With `Keyword` objects `teardown` is actually only created if needed, so I figured that there wouldn't be problems with them. Reverting the API change just to make `TestCase` objects use a little less memory didn't feel like a good idea.\r\n\r\nYesterday I totally by accident encountered a Python memory profiler called [Fil](https://pythonspeed.com/fil/). I had searched for this kind of tools earlier, but hadn't found this one. It looked really promising and targeted for exactly in our kind of use case. According to Fil docs it helps us to figure out:\r\n\r\n- Where peak memory usage is, also known as the high-water mark.\r\n- What code was responsible for allocating the memory that was present at that peak moment.\r\n\r\nTurned out Fil did what it promised and I was able to find few places where we use lot of memory and where the memory usage has increased from RF 3.2.2. The biggest problems that `Keyword.teardown` that I though wouldn't matter. It's true it's only created when needed, but we accessed `kw.teardown` in few central places (e.g. in `SuiteVisitor`) and that was enough. I commit a fix to this problem and to others I encountered separately.\r\n\r\nAfter profiling and tuning the memory usage has dropped considerably on my machine. Usage reported `/usr/bin/time -v` with the same test set I used earlier is now ~83MB. That's a huge from from ~123MB with RF 4.1.1 and also a big drop from ~103MB with RF 3.2.2. If I got my math right, with this set memory usage has dropped 33% compared to RF 4.1.1 and 20% compared to RF 3.2.2.\r\n\r\nAlthough these changes are pretty small, they still require new RF 4.1.2 release candidate and may require postponing the final release few days. Considering how big enhancements are, I consider that worth it and better than waiting for RF 5.0.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4114/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4112","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4112/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4112/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4112/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4112","id":1016131986,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ848kPGS","number":4112,"title":"Incompatible output.xml created if listener runs keyword in `end_keyword` inside FOR loop","user":{"login":"Harri","id":568873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODg3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harri","html_url":"https://github.com/Harri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013645,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":230194665,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzAxOTQ2NjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/rc%202","name":"rc 2","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/60","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/60","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/60/labels","id":7114136,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84AbI2Y","number":60,"title":"v4.1.2","description":"Final planned RF 4.1.x release and thus also the final release to support Python 2.\r\n\r\nMostly a bug fix release.

The default behavior of the underlying [subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen) is to inherit stdin from the parent process, but we instead hard code it to use `subprocess.PIPE`. The current behavior makes it possible to write to the stdin of the started process which can be useful. Unfortunately it can also cause problems as  #4065 demonstrates.\r\n\r\nWe already support configuring stdout and stderr, and it would be convenient to also be able to configure stdin. Possible values could be:\r\n\r\n- `String PIPE` to explicitly use `subprocess.PIPE`.\r\n- String `NONE` (case-insensitively to allow also `None`) to get `subprocess` default behavior.\r\n- Path to a file to use that file as the stdin. We just needed to open the wile and use the opened file object as the stdin.\r\n- Any string to be passed as stdin. We needed to create a temporary file where the text is written and pass that file as the stdin.\r\n- Any non-string we could pass to `subprocess.Popen` as-is. This would allow, for example, using stdout of another process as the stdin.\r\n\r\nIt's not a good idea in general to add new functionality in patch releases like RF 4.1.2. The reason I think we should make an exception is that we cannot really fix/workaround #4065 otherwise. It could be fixed by changing our default behavior from `subprocess.PIPE` to `None`, but that would be backwards incompatible and that's absolutely not OK in a patch release. The other solution would be postponing this to RF 5.0, but I consider adding this new functionality in RF 4.1.2 better.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4102/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4100","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4100/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4100/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4100/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4100","id":1010650323,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ848PUzT","number":4100,"title":"Java versions with version number not in format `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` do not work (e.g. OpenJDK 17)","user":{"login":"csantune","id":86595939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTk1OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86595939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantune","html_url":"https://github.com/csantune","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantune/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantune/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantune/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantune/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantune/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantune/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantune/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantune/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantune/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013645,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430421,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzA0MjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20critical","name":"priority: critical","color":"00441b","default":false,"description":""},{"id":229188865,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjkxODg4NjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/rc%201","name":"rc 1","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/60","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/60","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/60/labels","id":7114136,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84AbI2Y","number":60,"title":"v4.1.2","description":"Final planned RF 4.1.x release and thus also the final release to support Python 2.\r\n\r\nMostly a bug fix release.
